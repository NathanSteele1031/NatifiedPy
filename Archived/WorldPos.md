# Doing
I am going to work on the world position system. Everything in the game will have a world position including the camera so the scrolling with the camera when the player moves is possible without making any issues. 

## Progress
I have completed the positioning system with the camera and the world position system. (DONE)

I have added the camera and the player as world objects and have the world class as a variable in main. Next goal is to create the following of the camera on the player when getting close to the edge of the screen.

I have made the world objects class and world class. I just need to figure out the math to translate world position onto screen position for the player class and for the camera.
